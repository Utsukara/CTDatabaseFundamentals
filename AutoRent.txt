The AutoRent diagram is a 1-1 diagram that demonstrates that each car has a rental agreement. The car has properties like manufacturer to further describe the car, as well as,
an availability marker to display if the car is being currently rented. The functional key is used to reference the rental agreement to be referenced when the car is being rented
it also has the date of the rental agreement and the agreement description. Also, the functional key references the car that the agreement applies to. This allows efficiency in 
seeing the agreement that is active with the currently rented car. With concise attributes and single functional keys that link contracts with the correlating cars and vice versa
creates a concise database.
