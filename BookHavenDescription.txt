The BookHaven database that I outlined represents a database following 3NF. It ensures that all unique elements are linked together through their unique keys and each form 
of data contains its specific attributes without interdependencies. Each form of data has its own primary key to be accessed and eliminates functional dependencies resulting 
in defined attributes in each primary key. All attributes are focused on the key within the defined primary key. For BookHaven customers, transactions, books, and authors all
have their defined primary keys, functional keys and attributes that describe and allow interactions with other keys. Customers includes the customer id as a primary key followed
by a functional key for transactions and descriptions of the customer(name, email). All other data follows the same construct containing vital descriptors and functional keys to
other necessary elements.
